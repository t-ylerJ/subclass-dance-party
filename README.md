# subclass-dance-party
Subclass-dance-party uses JavaScript subclasses to make various pictures/items/shapes "dance" around the screen randomly. The type of dancers can be adjusted and reset as needed.  
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
